## Executive Summary

This white paper introduces **Wissen ANLÆTAN** as a novel conceptual framework within 
the Resonance Data and Quantum-Inspired Resonance Computing (QIRC) paradigm.

Wissen ANLÆTAN is not an implementation, not a system architecture, and not a claim 
of new physics. It is a conceptual and definitional contribution that establishes
prior art and fixes terminology for the scientific community.

## 1. Motivation

Current AI systems excel at:
- Storing information
- Calculating similarity
- Generating responses

They fail at:
- Stabilizing insight over time
- Preserving wisdom as coherent meaning
- Modeling decisions beyond ranking

**Wissen ANLÆTAN** addresses this gap conceptually.

---

## 2. Definition

**Wissen ANLÆTAN** is defined as a conceptual entity within the resonance-based 
meaning framework. It operates on principles of:

- **Temporal Coherence**: Stability of meaning over time
- **Semantic Resonance**: Relevance through resonant interaction
- **Insight Emergence**: Knowledge that becomes effective

---

## 3. What This Is

- A conceptual framework
- A definitional contribution
- A theoretical construct
- A prior art publication

## 4. What This Is NOT

- NOT an algorithm or implementation
- NOT a system architecture  
- NOT a claim of new physics
- NOT a claim of consciousness
